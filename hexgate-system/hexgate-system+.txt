# hexgate-system

My hexagonal stargate network design.  The addressing system is not completely my own work; I give credit to Sander Evers, the author of the [Hexmod representation](https://observablehq.com/@sanderevers/hexmod-representation?collection=@sanderevers/hex).  

Description:-

\- Hexagonal shape.  Sides must be a minimum of 9.5 units (a unit consists of 4 square tiles) in length.

\- 12 chevrons, although I prefer to call them registers, since mine don’t animate the way the ones in the Stargate IP do.

\- The first 6 registers occupy the vertices.  The second 6 registers occupy the midpoints between the vertices.  That is why preferred side length is 10.5 units of 4 cubes/tiles per unit.  That allows 4 units between each vertex and midpoint.

\- Each register can contain 3 digits, with a range of 0-9.

\- The dial home device has a seven segment display.  The displays are arranged in three vertical and four horizontal lines.

\- There are 12 registers, which can hold three digits each; 000-999.  This gives me one undecillion potential addresses.

\- 11 out of 12 registers will be locked for most uses.  This gives me an initial address pool of 1,000, with more if I need them later.  If the need increases, the computational capacity will have to as well.

\- A 13th register has been added, as a new first register; the type identifier.  This register will not be visible to or usable by the hexgates, which will have a first register value of 001 to the rest of the system.

Current first register values are:-

001 - Hexgates
002 - Computers
003 - Storage drives
004 - Directories
005 - Files
006 - Variables - Ensure that these are temporary and recycled when no longer needed.
007 - Functions
008 - Random seeds - Ensure that these are temporary and recycled when no longer needed.
999 - Translated subnet anchors

\- Although the subnet type will remain, travel between different networks of hexgates, is accomplished by storing the address of the galaxy itself,

\- For items within types 002 and 007, 000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000 is a universal exit and reset command, which can be sent as a second string, after the item’s current address has been connected to.  A new address for the item can then be sent as a third string.  This permits extremely rapid, dynamic reconfiguration of devices on demand.

\- There is now a second type of addressing system.  There are still 12 registers, but the number range of each, is now 00 to 36.  This is to incorporate Sander Evers’ Hexmod system, where a hexagonal grid is represented with the numbers 00 to 36.

\- Agent navigation through a hexgate works via two constants and a stack.  The first constant stores the address of the current hexagonal cell, the second constant stores the address of the next hexagonal cell, and the stack stores up to 37 previous addresses.

\- Hexagonal cells have been calculated as requiring a side length of 100 kb, which offers 24.681 Mb of space per cell, for a minimal Linux system, which enables a 1:1 ratio of disk space to RAM.  This also just barely allows for 24 1024 kb blocks, for the purpose of creating a file system with Fat32 or others.

I am not going to try to totally reinvent the wheel in terms of my operating system, or at least not yet.  For the moment, I will use Linux. 

Hexel advised me to use solid state drives to reduce the speed disparity between both, but I am still anxious about the longevity of SSDs in comparison with magnetic drives, even though the latter are slower.
