## Hexgate System

subject(hexgate addressing system).

definition(Extensible addressing system.  This originated for use with a
stargate network within a proposed computer game, but has since been found to
have other applications).

warning(This document describes the most foundational element of our entire 
system.  It is that on which everything else is based.  Changes to it 
should therefore only be made *very* rarely, and with *extreme* care).

hexgate-frame-shape(pointy top hexagon, with the upper isosceles triangles of
two lower adjacent hexagons, as lateral supports).

hexgate-frame-long-diagonal(8.125 meters).
hexgate-frame-constituent-hexagons-shape(flat top).
hexgate-frame-constituent-hexagons(13 per side).
hexgate-frame-constituent-hexagons-long-diagonal(0.625 meters)
hexgate-vertices(6).
hexgate-midpoints(6).
hexgate-register-display-definition+01(present on the front (facing the user)
of the hexgate's 6 vertices and 6 midpoints).
hexgate-register-display-definition+02(7 segment LED).

register-definition+01(memory cells for storing address segments).
register-definition+02(12 registers in total).
register-definition+03(All registers contain 3 digits).
register-definition+04(Each digit has a valid range of 0-9).
register-definition+05(Hexgate addresses are read from right to left; from
register 12 to register 1.  Register 12 contains the smallest set; the specific
current object or gate being referenced.  Register 1 references the highest
set)
