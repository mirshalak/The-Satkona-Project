EDIT 16/12/2024:-

I have just changed the license of this repository and all files, from 
Apache 2.0 to ISC.  My initial choice of the Apache 2.0 license was driven by 
concerns about ensuring the long-term availability of this code. However, 
I have always aspired to use a simpler, BSD-compatible license that aligns 
with the principles of open collaboration and unrestricted use.

More than that, however, the decision to choose the ISC license is considered
irreducibly deontological; I am doing it simply because I believe it is right, 
regardless of the consequences.  The Hexgate System in particular, being made 
purely of numbers as it is, is rightfully the property of the infinite Universe.

This is the repository of The Satkona Project.

The word "ṣaṭkoṇa" means "six angles" in Sanskrit.  I am using the rendering
"Satkona" because it is compatible with the ASCII character set, while the
original Sanskrit phoenetic symbols are not.

This repository is a gathering place for all information related to hexagons,
particularly focusing on code for rendering hexagonal grids in different
programming languages, and techniques for creating hexagons, as a topological
basis for use in computer games.  It is graciously acknowledged that in some
applications, (such as 3D rendering) the hexagon is not the most desirable shape
for topology.  This repository will include information about cases in which
hexagons may not be maximally desirable for use, as well as those in which they
are. Along these lines, CGP Grey's famous YouTube video about hexagons is
recommended, as are its' rebuttals.

This repository's first two offerings are code for rendering a hexagonal grid
with the Turtle API and the Python programming language, and code for rendering
the same hexagonal grid within the Blender open source 3D graphics program,
again in Python.  Both of these are also examples of a method of programming
which I learned from exposure to the FORTH programming language, which has
enabled me to rapidly begin to use programming languages which support
functions, and the use of an array as a numerical dictionary for said functions.

I hope this repository is useful, and may you be as blessed by the hexagon, as I
believe that I have been.
