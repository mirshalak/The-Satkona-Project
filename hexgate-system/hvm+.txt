# Hexgate virtual machine

There are three elements.

1.  The Hexgate address subsystem itself, defined in the Hexgate strict definition.

Hexgate addressing is the bedrock of this entire system.  An address space with
10^36 possible permutations, means that **everything** can have an address,
within a single global address space.  This in turn means that everything can
potentially be interconnected, and everything can be abstracted in any manner
imaginable.

2.  The Skeleton Key, or 8 core functions.

001:push  (Transmit data to stack memory)
002:store (Transmit data to register/heap memory)
003:pop (Receive data from stack memory)   
004:load (Receive data from register/heap memory)
005:define-word (This is equivalent to the word compilation pair in FORTH)
006:execute-word 
007:add  
008:subtract

3.  The file system.

top-level-directories("Every partition has 1023 top level subdirectories, from
001 to 1023.  These top level directories are viewed metaphorically as each
being the central 7th vertex of a hexagon.").

6-subdirectories("Each top level directory has 6 subdirectories, corresponding
with the lateral vertices of a hexagon.").

adjacency-manifest("The adjacency-manifest file resides within every top level
directory.  It lists all of the files present within the 6 subdirectories.").

adjacency-address("The adjacency address file resides within every top level
directory.  It contains the hexgate address for that top level directory.  Only
the top level directories have hexgate addresses.  This ensures efficient use of 
the directory space.")
