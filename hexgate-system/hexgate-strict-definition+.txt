    ## Hexgate System
    
    subject(hexgate addressing system).
    definition(Extensible addressing system.  This originated for use with a
    stargate network within a proposed computer game, but has since been found to
    have other applications).
    
    hexgate-frame-shape(pointy top hexagon, with the upper isosceles triangles of two lower adjacent hexagons, as lateral supports).
    hexgate-frame-long-diagonal(8.125 meters).
    hexgate-frame-constituent-hexagons-shape(flat top).
    hexgate-frame-constituent-hexagons(13 per side).
    hexgate-frame-constituent-hexagons-long-diagonal(0.625 meters)
    hexgate-vertices(6).
    hexgate-midpoints(6).
    hexgate-register-display-definition+01(present on the front (facing the user) of the
    hexgate's 6 vertices and 6 midpoints).
    hexgate-register-display-definition+02(7 segment LED).
    
    register-definition+01(memory cells for storing address segments).
    register-definition+02(12 registers in total).
    register-definition+03(All registers contain 3 digits).
    register-definition+04(Each digit has a valid range of 0-9).
    register-definition+05(Hexgate addresses are read from right to left; from register 12 to register 1.  Register 12 contains the smallest set; the specific current object or gate being referenced.  Register 1 references the highest set)
