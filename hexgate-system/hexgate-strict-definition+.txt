sysdsc(system-description) 

sysdsc+01(Addressing system for a system of portals
called Hexgates; an alternate version of the Stargates from that IP).

sysdsc+02(May be used for any system where objects require unique
identification).  

sysdsc+03(12 registers, 3 digits, 0-9).  

sysdsc+04(registers are read from left to right, from least to most specific).  
sysdsc+05(register 12 points to real objects; registers 1-11 refer to routing 
tables).

sysdsc+06(It is acknowledged that much other functionality could be added for 
specific use cases, but that will occur within other units.  The strict 
definition is intended to define the re-usable base primitive only, which may 
then be duplicated or instantiated into derivative works.  The license is 
therefore of direct practical importance).
