2.  The Skeleton Key, or 8 core functions.  This may be abbreviated to "SK8."

001:push  (Transmit data to stack memory)
002:store (Transmit data to register/heap memory)
003:pop (Receive data from stack memory)   
004:load (Receive data from register/heap memory)
005:define-word (This is equivalent to the word compilation pair in FORTH)
006:execute-word 
007:add  
008:subtract

sk8-purpose+01("To permit total reconstruction from the minimal viable initial
state.").

sk8-purpose+02("To create a semantic framework and execution model, which
allows the reliable generation of code by artificial intelligence.  It has been
observed that language models produce much more elegant and reliable code, when
the parameter stack is used as the central data structure.").

two-stacks("Parameter stack and return stack.").
parameter-stack-contents("Word parameter data.").
return-stack-contents("Addresses of 1 or more words to be executed.").
heap-contents("Definitions and contents of words.").
parameter-stack("Preferred mechanism for all general-purpose computation.").
store-and-load-words("Exist solely to support the operation of define-word and execute-word.").
store-and-load-words("Not to be used otherwise.").

word-addresses("Words are to have Hexgate addresses, following the above 8.").

loop-branch("Looping and branching are to be achieved via define-word,
execute-word, and the return stack.").

core-invariance("The core SK8 instruction set (001â€“008) must remain immutable
and distinct from all higher-level or API-specific word dictionaries. This
ensures minimal survivable execution and prevents dependency pollution.").

word-tokens("Words consist of individual tokens, which begin and end with the space character: ASCII decimal code 32.")
word-start("define-word")
word-second-token("word name")
word-end("000.").
word-end-explanation("Within define-word compilation mode, push 000 is not a runtime literal, but a control instruction equivalent to end-define.").
word-example("define-word dup heap-variable store heap-variable load push 000")
