This system is descended from FORTH, and is therefore meant to implement 
indirect threading, with no explicit branching in the core.

3 digit addresses are necessary to maintain length consistency with globally 
facing Hexgate addresses.

There are two stacks, a parameter and return stack.  There is also heap memory for 
the storage of words. Stack and heap implementation, and context shifting between 
parameter and return stack are host dependent.  

Words consist of tokens, bounded by the space character. (ASCII code 32)

Word format is as follows:-

define-word 
<3 digit, numerical Hexgate address> 
<word name> 
<word body>
end-define

Example:-

007 
014
foo
001 48
001 48
009
008
