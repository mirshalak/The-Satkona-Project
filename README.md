EDIT 16/12/2024:-

I have changed the license of this repository and all its files from Apache 2.0 to ISC.

My initial choice of the Apache 2.0 license was motivated by concerns about ensuring the 
long-term availability of this code. However, I have always aspired to use a simpler, 
BSD-compatible license that aligns with the principles of open collaboration and 
unrestricted use.

The decision to switch to the ISC license is grounded in ethical considerations. I believe 
in the simplicity and freedom that permissive licensing provides, and I no longer feel the 
need for additional legal safeguards against hypothetical risks.

As Theo de Raadt once said, "there is no right to avoid being sued," and I accept this 
reality. More importantly, I have chosen the ISC license because it is, in my view, 
the right thing to do, regardless of the consequences.

This change reinforces my commitment to making this code freely available for any purpose, 
in the true spirit of open source. The Hexgate System, composed entirely of numbers, 
is dedicated as a gift to the infinite Universe, whose order it reflects and serves.

This is the repository of The Satkona Project.

The word "ṣaṭkoṇa" means "six angles" in Sanskrit.  I am using the rendering
"Satkona" because it is compatible with the ASCII character set, while the
original Sanskrit phoenetic symbols are not.

This repository is a gathering place for all information related to hexagons,
particularly focusing on code for rendering hexagonal grids in different
programming languages, and techniques for creating hexagons, as a topological
basis for use in computer games.  It is graciously acknowledged that in some
applications, (such as 3D rendering) the hexagon is not the most desirable shape
for topology.  This repository will include information about cases in which
hexagons may not be maximally desirable for use, as well as those in which they
are. Along these lines, CGP Grey's famous YouTube video about hexagons is
recommended, as are its' rebuttals.

This repository's first two offerings are code for rendering a hexagonal grid
with the Turtle API and the Python programming language, and code for rendering
the same hexagonal grid within the Blender open source 3D graphics program,
again in Python.  Both of these are also examples of a method of programming
which I learned from exposure to the FORTH programming language, which has
enabled me to rapidly begin to use programming languages which support
functions, and the use of an array as a numerical dictionary for said functions.

I hope this repository is useful, and may you be as blessed by the hexagon, as I
believe that I have been.
