## Hexgate System

This document outlines the design and functionality of a hexagonal portal network, referred to as the Hexgate System.  The system originated as the result of a thought experiment, to see if such a portal system could be designed to be hexagonal instead of circular.  The numerical structure was also inspired by the Mayan Long Count Calendar system.

The virtual terrain navigation subsystem is inspired by Sander Evers' [Hexmod representation](https://observablehq.com/@sanderevers/hexmod-representation?collection=@sanderevers/hex).

### Key Features:

- **Hexagonal Structure**:
  - The Hexgate is hexagonal in shape with 12 registers, which function similarly to "chevrons" in other stargate systems. However, these registers are non-animated and fixed.

- **Register Placement**:
  - The first 6 registers are positioned at the vertices of the hexagon.
  - The next 6 registers are located at the midpoints of the edges between vertices.
  - The preferred side length of the hexagon is 12.5 units, with 4 tiles/cubes per unit. This allows 5 units of spacing between each vertex and midpoint.

- **Registers and Addressing**:
  - Each register can hold a 3-digit number ranging from 0 to 9.
  - A complete Hexgate address comprises 13 registers:
    - The **first register** serves as a type identifier.
    - The next 12 registers form the address of the target hexgate.
  - Example addresses:
    - Without type identifier: `098-639-513-096-733-491-511-977-946-059-167-505`
    - With type identifier (Random Seeds - 008): `008-098-639-513-096-733-491-511-977-946-059-167-505`

### Type Identifier Values:

The type identifier (first register) determines the nature of the address:

- **001**: Hexgates
- **002**: Computers
- **003**: Storage drives
- **004**: Directories
- **005**: Files
- **006**: Variables (temporary and recycled when not needed)
- **007**: Functions
- **008**: Random seeds (temporary and recycled when not needed)
- **999**: Translated subnet anchors

### Addressing Between Networks:

- By default, a Hexgate assumes travel within the same network.
- To connect to a different network, first dial the network address, followed by the specific gate address.
- This system increases complexity but offers a significantly larger address space.

### Special Address Commands:

- For items of types **002** (Computers) and **007** (Functions):
  - `000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000` serves as a universal exit and reset command.
  - Once connected to an item, this command can reset it, after which a new address can be sent to dynamically reconfigure the item.

### Virtual Navigation Mechanism:

- Navigation through a virtual hexagonal environment relies on two constants and a stack:
  - The **first constant** stores the address of the current hexagonal cell.
  - The **second constant** stores the address of the next hexagonal cell.
  - The **stack** holds up to 37 previous addresses for backtracking purposes.
  - For navigational purposes, every hexagonal cluster will be assumed to consist of 37 cells.  Each cell will contain its' own hexgate, permitting both linear and non-linear travel between cells. 

### Storage and Computing:

- Each hexagonal cell has a side length of 100 kilobytes (kb), providing:
  - **24.681 megabytes (Mb)** of usable space per cell.
  - A 1:1 ratio of disk space to RAM.
  - Space for **24 1024-kb blocks**, allowing the use of file systems like FAT32.
  - This configuration enables the deployment of a minimal Linux system within each cell.

This Hexgate System combines a unique addressing structure, robust navigation mechanics, and a scalable design to enable complex inter-network communication and resource management.
